For instance, by using LoRaWAN-enabled GPS trackers on plumbing vans, businesses can improve their dispatch efficiency and optimize routes, saving both time and fuel costs. Companies can also monitor equipment usage and identify which tools are used most often. This data enables businesses to make informed decisions about equipment investment, reducing unnecessary spending and maximizing ROI."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Moreover, introducing LoRaWAN in the plumbing business can also lead to new, untapped revenue streams. Offering customers the option to install smart, sensor-enabled plumbing systems could be a significant upsell opportunity. By providing these high-tech solutions, plumbers not only serve their customers better but also position themselves as industry leaders in technological innovation. This positioning could attract more customers and encourage existing ones to opt for higher-priced services."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Finally, LoRaWAN\u2019s benefits extend to environmental responsibility\u2014a selling point for many modern customers.
